# Assistive-For-Blind
Visually impaired individuals face challenges in accessing essential food labeling information in retail environments. This project aims to develop an AI-based system to assist them in retrieving product details, including nutritional content, ingredients, and allergens, using image recognition and text-to-speech (TTS) technology.

# Project Objective

• Develop an AI-powered system to help visually impaired individuals access food labeling information.

• Use Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and TTS to extract and convert label text into audible speech.

• Enable users to access product details through a smartphone camera or an embedded device.

# System Architecture

• The system consists of several key components:

• Image Preprocessing: Enhances label readability for improved OCR accuracy.

• Optical Character Recognition (OCR): Extracts text from food labels with high precision.

• Text-to-Speech (TTS) Technology: Converts extracted text into human-like speech.

• Machine Learning Models: Enhances recognition accuracy across various label formats, languages, and packaging designs.

# Software Requirements

• Compatible with Android, iOS, and Raspberry Pi OS.

• Uses OpenCV and TensorFlow for image processing and recognition.

• Implements OCR for text extraction and TTS engines for speech conversion.

• Adheres to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) for user interface design.

# Hardware Requirements

• Camera: Captures high-resolution images of product labels in various lighting conditions.

• Processor (Raspberry Pi): Supports real-time image recognition and text-to-speech conversion.

• Output Device (Speaker): Provides clear audio feedback for users.

• Potential Wearable Integration: Enables hands-free usage through smart glasses or other embedded devices.

# Impact and Benefits

• Promotes inclusivity in daily activities such as grocery shopping and meal preparation.

• Enhances autonomy for visually impaired individuals in making informed dietary choices.

• Uses machine learning to improve recognition accuracy across various product labels.

• Potential applications extend to personal care products and pharmaceuticals.

# Future Enhancements

• Real-time updates for evolving food labeling standards.

• Integration with wearable devices for enhanced accessibility.

• Multi-language support for broader usability.

• Expansion to IoT applications for wider accessibility beyond smartphones and Raspberry Pi.



This project represents a promising step toward addressing the accessibility needs of diverse user groups, encouraging a more inclusive shopping experience, and empowering visually impaired individuals to navigate retail environments independently. As the technology continues to evolve, it holds great potential for transforming shopping experiences and fostering a more inclusive world for all
